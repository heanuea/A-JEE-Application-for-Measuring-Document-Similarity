# DocumentSimilarity

## **_Project Overview_** 
#### *Object Oriented Design principles & Patterns Module - Lecturer: [John Healy](https://github.com/bradanfeasa) - 4th Year Software Development*
A Java web application that enables two or more text documents to be compared for similarity.

Your implementation should include the following features:

1. A document or URL should be specified or selected from a web browser and then
dispatched to a servlet instance running under Apache Tomcat.

2. Each submitted document should be parsed into its set of constituent shingles and
then compared against the existing document(s) in an object-oriented database (db4O)
and then stored in the database.

3. The similarity of the submitted document to the set of documents stored in the
database should be returned and presented to the session user.
